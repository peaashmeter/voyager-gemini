# Voyager: An Open-Ended Embodied Agent with Large Language Models
Check for the original readme there: https://github.com/MineDojo/Voyager

## Voyager-Gemini: Voyager, but powered with Google Gemini instead of GPT-4!
Tested with python 3.9.

To use:
1) Get your GOOGLE_API_TOKEN
2) Edit run.py
3) `python run.py`

**NOTE**: There are a lot of location restrictions atm for Gemini. 
Check https://ai.google.dev/available_regions 

Subjectively, Gemini works quite faster than GPT-4.
